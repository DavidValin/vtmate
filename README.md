### Status

✅ Ready to kick in! [Download](https://github.com/DavidValin/ai-mate/releases)

## How it works

`RECORD -> STT -> LLM -> TTS -> PLAYBACK`

```
- You start the program and start talking.
- Once audio is detected (based on sound-threshold-peak option) it will start recording.
- As soon as there is a time of silence (based on end_silence_ms option), it will transcribe the recorded audio using speech to text (stt).
- The transcribed text will be sent to the ai model (through ollama)
- The ai model will reply with text.
- The text converted to audio using text to speech (tts) via OpenTTS.
- You can interrupt the ai agent at any moment by start speaking, this will cause the response and audio to stop and you can continue talking.
```

## Features

- 📌 Continuous Voice chat (live conversation): `records user continuously and stops on silence, submitting the request to the agent`
- 📌 Voice interrupt: `the agent stops talking if you interrupt via voice`
- 📌 Recording Pause / Resume: `toggle "<SPACE>" key to pause / resume voice recording only`
- 📌 Stop PlayBack: `press "<ESCAPE>" ONCE to stop the playback for the current response`
- 📌 Interrupt: `press "<ESCAPE>" TWICE to interrupt the current response alltogether`
- 📌 Push to Talk mode (PTT): `run it with --ptt and keep <SPACE> while talking and release to stop recording`
- 📌 Voice speed change: `change the agent voice speed by pressing <ARROW_UP> / <ARROW_DOWN> (applicable to next response)`
- 📌 Voice change (realtime): `change the agent voice by pressing <ARROW_LEFT> / <ARROW_RIGHT> (applicable to next response)`
- 📌 Integrated `whisper`
- 📌 Integrated `kokoro TTS` system
- 📌 Interface with `OpenTTS` system
- 📌 Supports `ollama` or `llama-server` or `llamafile`
- 📌 28 languages supported (`ai-mate --list-voices`)
- 📌 Use any gguf model from huggingface.com or ollama models (small models reply faster)

## LLM integration

- ✅ ollama - all versions (default)
- ✅ llama-server / llamafile - all versions
- ✅ openclaw / clawbot (voice chat with your agent by connecting ai-mate to the endpoint)

You can run the models locally (by default) or remotely by configuring the base urls via cli option.

## TTS engine support

- ✅ Kokoro TTS (default and integrated)
- ✅ OpenTTS (requires external service)

## Acceleration support

Do you have GPU? (nvidia? an apple computer?) Great! then ai-mate speed is at lighting speed =)

* To be able to use acceleration, pick the built version for your hardware from [Releases list](https://github.com/DavidValin/ai-mate/releases)
* For CUDA install CUDA Toolkit. For Vulkan install VULKAN SDK

```
Platform   Arch    CPU    OpenBLAS   CUDA   Metal   Vulkan
--------   ----    ---    --------   ----   -----   ------
macOS      ARM64   ✅    optional     n/a     ✅      ❌
Linux      AMD64   ✅       ✅        ✅      n/a     ✅
Linux      ARM64   ✅       ✅        ❌      n/a     ✅
Windows    x86     ⚠️       ⚠️        ⚠️      n/a     ⚠️
Windows    ARM64   ⚠️       ⚠️        ⚠️      n/a     ⚠️
```

## Installation

### 📌 1. **Download ai-mate**
- `https://github.com/DavidValin/ai-mate/releases`
- Move the binary to a folder in your $PATH so you can use `ai-mate` command anywhere

### 📌 2. **Install llm engine (needed for ai responses)**

Option A- ollama (the default)
- Install `https://ollama.com/download`.
- Pull the model you want to use with ai-mate, for instance: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`.

Option B- llamafile support
- Download a llamafile `https://huggingface.co/mozilla-ai/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-llamafile/blob/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.llamafile` (this contains an ai model and the server in a single file).
- Once downloaded, if in windows `rename the .llamafile to .exe`; in linux / mac `chmod +x Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.llamafile`.

Option C- llama-server support.
- Install llama.cpp: `https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp`.
- Download a gguf model: `https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf?download=true`.

### 📌 3. **(Windows only) Install supported terminal**

- Install Windows Terminal (which supports emojis): `https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701` (use this terminal to run ai-mate)

### 📌 4. **(Optional) OpenTTS support**

- `docker pull synesthesiam/opentts:all`

## How to use it

Default configuration example:

```
ollama serve
ai-mate
```

Push to Talk (PTT) example:

```
ollama serve
ai-mate --ptt --model "llama3:8b"
```

llamafile example:

```
./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.llamafile --server
ai-mate --llm llama-server
```

llama-server example:

```
llama-server -m Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf
ai-mate --llm llama-server
```

Below are the default parameters, which you can override, example:

```
ai-mate \
  --llm ollama \
  --tts kokoro \
  --language en \
  --sound-threshold-peak 0.10 \
  --end-silence-ms 850 \
  --whisper-model-path ~/.whisper-models/ggml-tiny.bin \
  --model "llama3.2:3b" \
  --ollama-url "http://localhost:11434"
```

You can just override a specific variable, for example:

```
ai-mate --tts opentts --model "llama3.2:3b" --language ru
ai-mate --model "llama3.2:3b" --language zh
ai-mate --llm llama-server --language it
ai-mate --language es --whisper-model-path ~/.whisper-models/ggml-medium-q5_0.bin`
```

If you want to use OpenTTS, start the docker service first: `docker run --rm --platform=linux/amd64 -p 5500:5500 synesthesiam/opentts:all` (it will pull the image the first time). Adjust the platform as needed depending on your hardware. 

If you need help:

```
ai-mate --help
```

## Build ai-mate from source code

- There are 3 script `build_macos.sh`, `build_linux.sh` and `build_windows.bat`
- The scripts accept --arch flag to build for specific architecture
- If you are building for specific acceleration, make sure the SDKs are installed
- During build, TTS and STT models are fetched locally (around 1GB)
- The built binaries will be placed under `./dist` once built

***MacOS***
- (require docker for building the image)
- You can only build the MacOS build from a mac machine
```
./build_macos.sh
```

***Linux***
- (require docker for building the image)
- Openblas is always included in all variants by default

Examples:
```
WITH_CUDA=0 ./build_linux.sh --arch amd64
WITH_CUDA=1 ./build_linux.sh --arch amd64
LINUX_WITH_VULKAN=1 WITH_CUDA=0 ./build_linux.sh --arch amd64

WITH_CUDA=0 ./build_linux.sh --arch arm64
LINUX_WITH_VULKAN=1 WITH_CUDA=0 ./build_linux.sh --arch arm64
```

***Windows***
- You can only build the Windows build from windows
- You need to install [Visual CPP Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)

```
build_windows.bat cpu
build_windows.bat cuda
build_windows.bat openblas
build_windows.bat vulkan
```

## Tricks

For conveniance create bash aliases with the options you want to use, example:

```
# English
alias ai-mate_qwen='ai-mate --model "qwen3:30b"'
alias ai-mate_llama='ai-mate --model "llama3:8b"'

# Spanish
alias ai-mate_es_qwen='ai-mate --model "qwen3:30b" --language es'
alias ai-mate_es_llama='ai-mate --model "llama3:8b" --language es'
```

## Useful to know

ai-mate self contains espeak-ng-data, the whisper tiny & small models and kokoro model and voices which will be autoextracted when running ai-mate if they are not found in next locations:

- `~/.ai-mate/espeak-ng-data.tar.gz`
- `~/.whisper-models/ggml-tiny.bin`
- `~/.whisper-models/ggml-small.bin`
- `~/.cache/k/0.onnx`
- `~/.cache/k/0.bin`
